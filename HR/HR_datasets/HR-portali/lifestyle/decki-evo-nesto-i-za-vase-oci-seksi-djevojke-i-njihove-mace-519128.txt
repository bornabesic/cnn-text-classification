Momci su nam se žalili kako su zanemareni kada smo objavili seksi muškarce s mačka u rukama pa smo pronašli nešto i za njihove oči. Radi se o djevojkama koje se rado fotkaju sa svojim mačkama, a slike objavljuju na Instagramu. Uživajte! Today I photographed my 100th cat lady! I will share their photo/story tomorrow. It's been so fun meeting all these wonderful women and their cute kitties. As many of you know, cats are not an easy subject. They almost always refuse to sit still for photos and they know exactly where to sit so they're just out of frame. It's always amazing when I can get two cats in the same shot for more than a few minutes. Looking forward to photographing 100 more cats and their girls. 😸 #100 #catladies #catmom #catsofinstagram #catlover #adoptdontshop A post shared by Girls and Their Cats (@girlsandtheircats) on Mar 29, 2016 at 5:06pm PDT Leilani and Shrampton in LES for #girlsandtheircats #girlsandtheircatsnyc @myshimoda @shrampton All photos by BriAnne Wills #catlady #gingercat #catlover #girls #lingerie #photoseries #bookproject #scottishfold A post shared by Girls and Their Cats (@girlsandtheircats) on Dec 28, 2015 at 1:09pm PST Emily and George in Bed-Stuy. @emilyrosetheo ***Emily was my very first girl and her cat. I had originally set out to do a nude series, but when I saw her with George I knew I had to change my direction. *** 🐈🐈🐈"I got George in 2010. I had moved in with my boyfriend at the time and left my senior kitty at my parents place because I felt bad moving him from the only home he knew. But I needed that cat companionship. A coworker of ours had this stray in her backyard that kept having litters under her deck. So she had some babies available for adoption, We ended up getting two cats - George and his brother Fred. Awhile later when me and the BF broke up, we spilt them up :( So now it's just been me and George for a few years and he is the sweetest little heart breaker. A big change from when we first got them because they were about 3 months old already and terrified of everything! It took a lot of socializing, but he is pretty much out of his shell now and will fall all over himself just to be pet. You never really know what kind of personality you are going to find in a cat, but I can say for certain I really lucked out with George!"🐈🐈🐈 All photos by BriAnne Wills #catlady #catsofinstagram #adoptdontshop #bookproject #photoseries #shotonfilm #35mm #girlsandtheircatsNYC A post shared by Girls and Their Cats (@girlsandtheircats) on Nov 13, 2015 at 8:28am PST Singer/dancer Giuliana and Yoncé in Williamsburg for #girlsandtheircats.

My roommate’s co-worker’s family was giving away a litter of kittens their family cat had just given birth to a few weeks earlier. We drove all the way out to their farmhouse, where the kittens were all in a rumpus room playing together. When I met Lola, she was a little black puff ball who could fit in the palm of my hand. Her meow was so soft I could barely hear it. I looked at her and just knew she was my new companion. At six weeks old, she was sweet and spent her days playing with her sister cat, who my roommate adopted the same day. Today, she’s grown into a powerful and sassy lady, but is still as cuddly and loyal as ever. Lola and I have lived in three different cities now together and I’ve gone through a lot of major transitions in the 9 years she’s been my pet! She loves to wake me up in the morning by putting her tail in my face, and always makes sure to sit on my lap while I’m in my bathrobe putting on makeup in the morning. She also loves to rub her face against my pen while I’m trying to write poems. I love her so much!"

As the other cats meowed and fought for attention, he sat quietly in the corner shivering. They informed me that he may be suffering from cat laryngitis and may never meow. They tried to push "healthier" kittens on me, but he was the one that wanted. To this day, he still does not meow. Mr. Claude is by far my best friend. He has traveled from Florida to NYC with me, has seen me through many breakups and job failures. And in July 2013, probably the hottest summer I have ever experienced, I helped him recover from "death's grip." At the time I was living in the Lower East Side in a 5 story walk up with no a/c unit – it’s no joke, heat literally rises. Mr. Claude had been acting kind of sluggish. I blamed it on the record breaking heat and my recent change in relationship status. My boyfriend of about 4 years moved out earlier that week and I thought, like a great friend that he was, Mr. Claude was mimicking my displays of heartache. We would lie lethargically on the couch together, when I cried he would hollow too. I did not become concerned until I realized that he was not drinking his water and there was blood in his litter box. Worried that he was severely dehydrated, I decided to try and force feed him pedialyte through a bottle. This was a bad idea – Mr. Claude let out a painstaking cry and passed out. Horrified, I hailed a cab 11 blocks to The Village Veterinarian. The Vet informed me that Mr. Claude’s bladder had exploded due to a large kidney stone that was preventing him from peeing. The Vet said it was possible that he may die. I lost my shit and hysterically begged the Vet to save him. I never thought I'd ever find myself in the position of agreeing to a $2,500 life-saving “sex change” for my cat, but the thought of possibly losing my buddy was absolutely unfathomable. Long story short, after weeks at the Vet, Mr. Claude recovered gracefully. My friends now joke and call him Miss Claudette."

A few years ago I was finally living alone and ready to care for another living creature. I’d long held the idea that I wanted a boy cat. Many friends’ cats throughout the years were boys and so I already favored them and in my own life I get along better with males. I always wanted a cat of a particular aesthetic- striped and wild looking. So from the moment I saw this group of kittens I knew someone from their family was to be mine. This little energetic babe immediately came running up to me and curled into a little ball on my lap. I was told it was a boy; he was adorable, affectionate and that seemed to be that. Then I notice this petite little angel walking away from me completely unbothered. Noting my indecision the adoption people tried to sell me on them both. They made a strong case for two-cat households (they’ll have each other to play with/not be lonely/your furniture will suffer less as a result). So I was convinced I’d get a boy and a girl. As they are preparing the paperwork I hear a whispering amongst the ladies- turns out the’d been mistaken and both kittens were girls. These little witches tricked me! It was too late to conceive of a life without either of them. Cosey is the alpha butch athletic tomboy who was mistaken for a he initially. True to her name, she will cozy up on my lap, dart herself in front of you as you are walking to assure you cannot deny her a pet, and generally requires a lot of a lot of affection. Fanni is still the mostly unaffected sweet ingenue princess who prefers to do her own thing unless she feels like indulging you in her presence. They have such distinct personalities and ways about them, I often say they are “people” but they’re actually better! No matter what mischievous activities they get in to, or how much their cat hair disrupts my mostly black wardrobe, or even the reality that I’m allergic to their dander; they have showed me what it is to care for another being and my love for them is boundless and eternal." A post shared by Girls and Their Cats (@girlsandtheircats) on Mar 30, 2016 at 5:23pm PDT Samantha and Wednesday in Bed-Stuy for #girlsandtheircats 🐈🐈🐈 "If Regina George were a cat she would be Wednesday. She's beautiful and bitchy. She loves on my boyfriend in front of me and then looks me directly in the eyes and glares at me. She's basically laughing in my face. But when it's just me and her at home for a few days I get to see the true Wednesday. She crawls into my shirt and sleeps on my chest. I think she loves me but just doesn't want to show it in front of her dad because she doesn't want to betray him. When he's gone she will follow me around and scream for me while I am in the bathroom. She hates me in front of people then loves me when we are alone. But isn't that how all mother and daughter relationships are?" @bella_malattia All photos by BriAnne Wills #girlsandtheircatsnyc #bookproject #photoseries #catmom #sphynx #catlady #catsofinstagram A post shared by Girls and Their Cats (@girlsandtheircats) on Dec 7, 2015 at 1:22pm PST
